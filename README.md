# persian-twitter

Improve Twitter and TweetDeck user experience for Persian users (a Chrome extension)


## Installation

I can't publish this extension to Chrome Web Store at this moment. They need credit card submission for publishing extensions. I may be able to publish it there soon or may not!

For now, you can grab the CRX file from releases page and install it manually.
